Silhouette score is a metric to compare the effectiveness of a clustering technique. It is also used to calculate the optimal number of clusters for distance based clustering techniques such as K Means and is better than the alternatives such as the elbow method.

Silhouette score is calculated by comparing the average intra cluster distance with the average inter cluster distance. The idea behind is that the under optimal scenarios, all clusters should be as distinct and separable from each other as possible. This gives us a score between -1 and 1 where 1 denotes that all clusters are perfect whereas -1 denotes that all data points are clustered in the wrong cluster.
