ReLU is an abbreviation for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an activation function which has the value 0 for all negative values and the value f(x) = x for all positive values. The ReLU has a simple activation function which makes it fast to compute and while the sigmoid and tanh activation functions saturate at higher values, the ReLU has a potentially infinite activation, which addresses the problem of vanishing gradients.
