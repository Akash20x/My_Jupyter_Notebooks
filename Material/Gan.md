GANs consist of two networks: a discriminator and a generator. The role of the discriminator is to tell apart the real data from the fake (here the data used is the MNIST digit dataset). The role of the generator is to create fake data that can fool the discriminator. In GAN both networks are trained simultaneously using an adversarial process. The discriminator learns to better tell the data apart whereas the generator becomes better at generating synthetic data that can pass as original.
