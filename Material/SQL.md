There are four main ways to combine the records from one or more tables:
* JOIN – Use joins to combine columns from one or more queries into one result.
* UNION – Use Unions and other set operators to combine rows from one or more queries into one result with no duplicates.
* UNION ALL – Use Union all and other set operators to combine rows from one or more queries into one result including duplicates from both the queries.
* Sub Queries – These can be used to perform a separate search in the database showed results can be used in another query.
