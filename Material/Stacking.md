Stacking or Stacked Generalization is an ensemble machine learning algorithm. It uses a meta-learning algorithm to learn how to best combine the predictions from two or more base machine learning algorithms. The benefit of stacking is that it can harness the capabilities of a range of well-performing models on a classification or regression task and make predictions that have better performance than any single model in the ensemble.

Dimensionality Reduction: Having a large number of dimensions in the feature space can mean that the volume of that space is very large. This can dramatically impact the performance of machine learning algorithms fit on data with many input features, generally referred to as the “curse of dimensionality”. This reduces the number of dimensions of the feature space, hence the name “dimensionality reduction.”

To address nonlinear relationships within the data, we can turn to a class of methods known as manifold learning—a class of unsupervised estimators that seeks to describe datasets as low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces.
