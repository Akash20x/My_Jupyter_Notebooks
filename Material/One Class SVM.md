One Class SVM is an algorithm from the Support vector machines family that is trained on normal points. Using the normal points as reference, it creates a decision boundary around them which helps it identify which new point is an outlier and which is not.

Like SVMs, One Class SVM create non linear decision boundaries by projecting the data points into high dimensional space. This is achieved by using a kernel trick that can calculate the relationships between point vectors in high dimensions without actually projecting them into that space.
