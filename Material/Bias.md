Bias are the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn.
Generally, linear algorithms have a high bias making them fast to learn and easier to understand but generally less flexible. In turn, they have lower predictive performance on complex problems that fail to meet the simplifying assumptions of the algorithms bias.

Low Bias: Suggests less assumptions about the form of the target function.

High-Bias: Suggests more assumptions about the form of the target function.

Examples of low-bias machine learning algorithms include: 
Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines.

Examples of high-bias machine learning algorithms include: 
Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression
