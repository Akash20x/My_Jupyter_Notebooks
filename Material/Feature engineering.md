📌Always generate new features based on domain knowledge.💹

📌If you feel there is an interesting relationship between 2 existing features, but can't directly see their effects with the target variable then you may introduce a new feature with a multiplication of both of the existing ones.✌🏻

📌Gradient boosting models have in built feature importance functions. Hence using them as baselines help a lot in data understanding as well.😇

📌Always think of using groupby as a feature engineering technique. Try to group data at different levels and see the effects.😏

📌Avoid unnecessary feature engineering tools. The features that will come out from your understanding of the data will always be better.🤔
