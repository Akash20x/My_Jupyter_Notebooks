1) If a model performs better on training set than testing set, it might be due to overfitting. The performance is required to be significantly better in training set in order to overfit the model.

2) We can learn the learning dynamics of the model via using learning curve plot with incremental key hyper parameters on both train and test data and check the consequent accuracy scores.

3) Learning curves can help us understand the underlying significance of the overfitting.
Hence, overfiting is not always the root cause behind poor performance of model when training accuracy is high.
